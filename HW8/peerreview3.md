### Clarity:
The plot is simple to read and understand. Choice of 3d plotting is good very good, especially annotating the percentages on each bar makes 3d plot simple to understand.

### Aesthetic:
The choice of colours is good, distinguishable by colour blind people. 

### Honesty:
The plot is honest 

### Suggestion:
It's a very good plot, I like it. If you could draw a line to show how percentages increased and decreased over the years, it would be understanable at a glance of a second. Its a good plot even without it.
